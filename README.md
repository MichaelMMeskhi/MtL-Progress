This document aims to track the progress in Meta-Learning (MtL) and give an overview of the state-of-the-art (SOTA) across the most common MtL tasks. It aims to cover both traditional and core MtL tasks.

#### Guidelines

**Results** &nbsp; Results reported in published papers are preferred; an exception may be made for influential preprints.

**Datasets** &nbsp; Datasets should have been used for evaluation in at least one published paper besides the one that introduced the dataset.

**Code** &nbsp; We recommend to add a link to an implementation 
if available. You can add a `Code` column (see below) to the table if it does not exist.
In the `Code` column, indicate an official implementation with [Official](http://link_to_implementation).
If an unofficial implementation is available, use [Link](http://link_to_implementation) (see below).
If no implementation is available, you can leave the cell empty.
