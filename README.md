# Tracking Progress in Meta-Learning

## Description


Meta-Learning is gaining popularity in Machine Learning as a progressive step to Artificial General Intelligence (AGI). Lots of work has been done in the past 2 decades in Meta-Learning. This repository aims to track the progress in Meta-Learning (MtL) and give an overview of the state-of-the-art (SOTA) across the most common MtL problems and research topics. It aims to cover both traditional and core MtL tasks.

The goal of this repository is to become the center of information for anything related to Meta-Learning. We are also building a online community on our [Reddit page]().

### Contributing

#### Guidelines

- **Results** &nbsp; Results reported in published papers are preferred; an exception may be made for influential preprints.

- **Datasets** &nbsp; Datasets should have been used for evaluation in at least one published paper besides the one that introduced the dataset.

- **Code** &nbsp; We recommend to add a link to an implementation 
if available. You can add a `Code` column (see below) to the table if it does not exist.
In the `Code` column, indicate an official implementation with [Official](http://link_to_implementation).
If an unofficial implementation is available, use [Link](http://link_to_implementation) (see below).
If no implementation is available, you can leave the cell empty.

- **Research Problems** &nbsp; Problems listed in the table of contents are the most important/hot problems out there. For other problems please post them in the research folder README and on our [Reddit page]().

### Collaborations

I welcome anyone willing to work with me on keeping this repository up to date and as well as working on publishing/experimenting on research problems mentioned above. Just send me an email and we can take it from there.

### Wish list

These are tasks and datasets that are still missing:
