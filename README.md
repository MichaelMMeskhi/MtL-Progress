# Tracking Progress in Meta-Learning

![Metaleanring](./resources/img/logo.png)

## Description


Meta-Learning is gaining popularity in Machine Learning as a progressive step to Artificial General Intelligence (AGI). Lots of work has been done in the past 2 decades in Meta-Learning. This repository aims to track the progress in Meta-Learning (MtL) and give an overview of the state-of-the-art (SOTA) across the most common MtL problems and research topics. It aims to cover both traditional and core MtL tasks.

The goal of this repository is to become the center of information for anything related to Meta-Learning. We are also building a online community on our [Reddit page](https://www.reddit.com/r/MetaLearningML/).

# Resources for Students

One of the best resources I have found for graduate students on how to deal with Ph.D. related stress, how to conduct good research, or how to write and read papers and much more can be found in [this list](http://richb.rice.edu/signal-processing/research-resources/) compiled by a professor at Rice Univeristy.
